# Spring Boot API secured with JWT
This sample application shows how to develop a Restful api with
SpringBoot and secure it using Spring Security via JSON Web Tokens.

## How to setup the application and run it
* Make sure you have gradle installed on your system and an IDE. If 
you don't have an IDE don't worry you can still follow with a text editor and 
the terminal.
* Make sure you have Java 8 or 10 installed on your system. [Get it here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html);
